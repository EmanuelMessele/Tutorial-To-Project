# Things I Have Learned

* We can connect python to our js backend files using execfile function from child_process module. I would rather just use all JS but workign with API's seems easier and more reliable using Python since they are regularly looked at

# Getting the transcript working

It took so much time trying to figure out how to get the transcripts working. I tried so many apis from npm, and github, and i just couldn't get it working. At first, I thought it was my own fault, issues with my syntax, then I looked at the githubs and issues, and noticed these apis just dont work. 

I moved to python, where I felt like the API's would be more consistently regulated and finally with help with AI got it done. 

Note: I used json.dumps(text) --> all we did was looked at transcript which is just a list of fetchedTranscriptSnippet objects, and extracted all the text peices finally gettting the text.
